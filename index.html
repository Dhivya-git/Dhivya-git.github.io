                <p class="name-job">Aspiring Software Engineer</p>

                <p>I am an aspiring Software Engineer keen to get back into IT. I am a creative individual who finds 
                    developing software solutions immensely rewarding. I have been intrigued by technologies for as long
                    as I could remember and have always wanted to help create robust software systems using cutting edge 
                    technologies that help progress mankind. Helping with the advancement of humanity through technology,
                    is something I am passionate about, which I think I can achieve being a software engineer.
                </p>

                <p>I have a Bachelor Of Engineering degree in Information Technology with a history of working for Cisco 
                    Offshore Development Centre, world leader in providing network solutions. I was recognised with SPARC 
                    award from HCL Technologies for achieving high level of customer satisfaction which shows my positive 
                    work ethics.
                </p>

                <p>The process of contributing to develop a software, then watching it flourish, I believe, is extremely
                    rewarding. The best part of having a software engineering career for me seems to be the problem-solving 
                    aspect - I will face numerous challenges, but I will try to solve them utilising the knowledge and skills 
                    I have acquired previously and with the ones I am constantly learning, combined with my creativity and 
                    imagination. I am always eager to learn new technologies and to utilize my knowledge to my highest 
                    ability. Eventually, I want to feel proud and satisfied on my performance wherever I work.
